                    I received PhD degree in the Department of Electronic and Engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong
                    University, 2013. From Fall 2013, I join in the School of Electronic and Information
                    Engineering in South China University of Technology as an Assistant Professor. I
                    am broadly interested in wireless communications, including theoretical analysis, signal
                    processing and optimization.
